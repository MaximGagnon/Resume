# Data Sources

This document describes the data sources used in the application.

## HTML Content

The project uses HTML files as a data source, which are likely parsed and rendered within components.

- **`cool.html`**: A file containing HTML content. Its specific purpose is not immediately clear from the name.

- **`mathematical-mosaic-html.html`**: This file likely contains the primary HTML structure or content for the `MathematicalMosaic` component.

- **`mathematical-mosaic-named.html`**: A variation of the mosaic data, possibly with named elements or a different structure.

- **`mathematical-mosaic.html`**: Another file related to the `MathematicalMosaic` component, perhaps a different version or a fallback.
